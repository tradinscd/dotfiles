dotfile organization done via http://codingkilledthecat.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/git-dotfiles-and-hardlinks/.

Some notes:
1. 'git rm' literally removes the file from local directory. Use 'git rm --cached', or my lovable alias 'gr'.
2. Don't add folders, only specific files. The only folders added are gm_scripts.
3. The system-dotfiles are manual copy and pastes of system config files that I've edited and want to backup. I don't want to have the actual files in ~/system-dotfiles and symlink them, since that's a really bad idea. Manual copy-pastas for these are fine.

Quick-Start:
1. Add: 'ga file'.
2. Commit: gc "commit msg"
3. Push: gp.

Super-Command: gcp.
