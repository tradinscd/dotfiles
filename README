ARGH! Okay, so I've finally found the best solution into pushing things into the Github repository.

Here's the link:

I've literally followed all those steps unwittingly, and finally came into the proper solution as a mishap from my previous blunders.

Some notes:
1. Don't use 'git rm', since it actually does remove the file from the directory, and not just the git repository.
2. Don't add folders, only specific files.

Guide:
0. To add a new file: 'git add -f file'.
1. 'git add -A'
2. 'git commit -m "commit message"'
3. 'git push -u origin master
