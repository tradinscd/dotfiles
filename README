dotfile organization done via http://codingkilledthecat.wordpress.com/2012/08/08/git-dotfiles-and-hardlinks/.

Some notes:
1. 'git rm' literally removes the file from local directory. Use 'git rm --cached'.
2. Don't add folders, only specific files. The only folders added are gm_scripts.
3. The system-dotfiles are manual copy and pastes of system config files that I've edited and want to backup. I don't want to have the actual files in ~/system-dotfiles and symlink them, since that's a really bad idea. Manual copy-pastas for these are fine.

Guide:
0. To add a new file: 'git add -f file'.
1. 'git add -A'
2. 'git commit -m "commit message"'
3. 'git push -u origin master
