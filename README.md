# dotfiles

This repository collects configuration files for my PCs.

See `doc/` for documentation; `bin/` for scripts.

## macos
I have since converted to Mac for default functionality and
collaboration purposes.

A demo of my typical workflow. A text editor and any PDFs are on
my first desktop, followed by a browser in the second desktop, a
terminal in the third desktop, and a papers app in the fourth desktop.
Finally, my fifth desktop is empty, as it handles miscellaneous
applications.

My old dotfiles are split among three branches:
+ [`laptop`](https://github.com/dustinvtran/dotfiles/tree/laptop):
  Dotfiles that are unique to the laptop.
+ [`desktop`](https://github.com/dustinvtran/dotfiles/tree/desktop)
  Dotfiles that are unique to the desktop.
+ [`master`](https://github.com/dustinvtran/dotfiles/tree/master):
  Dotfiles that are shared between laptop and desktop.
