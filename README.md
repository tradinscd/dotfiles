## macos
I have since converted to Mac for default functionality and
collaboration purposes (in sacrifice of aesthetics and uniqueness).

Top is my typical workflow for my first desktop, followed by a browser
in the second desktop, a terminal in the third desktop, and a papers
app in the fourth desktop. Bottom is my fifth desktop, which handles
miscellaneous applications.

## arch linux

My old dotfiles are split among three branches:
+ [`laptop`](https://github.com/dustinvtran/dotfiles/tree/laptop):
  Dotfiles that are unique to the laptop.
+ [`desktop`](https://github.com/dustinvtran/dotfiles/tree/desktop)
  Dotfiles that are unique to the desktop.
+ [`master`](https://github.com/dustinvtran/dotfiles/tree/master):
  Dotfiles that are shared between laptop and desktop.
