This is a document which compiles a list of things that I still have to configure or do. This is purely for personal (and
 documented) use, so I can keep track of features I desire and when I complete them.

Each to-do item for an application is assigned toward a priority level depending on how much I personally want them to be
 implemented. Then in the Priority categories, each application is sorted by alphabetical order. Then each item for an
 application is itself ranked by descending order of subpriority.

Highest Priority {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Seagate External Harddrive
    * Get it working.

Conky/dzen
    * mail
        Get script as notification working.
        Change gmail's xbm.
    * mpv
        Somehow grep with regexp and gray any parts of the filenames in [...]

i3
    * Have the workspaces icons turn sideways on focus.
        Find how to set the workspaces to change icons like that.
        Find the appropriate icons.

ranger
    * Have the bottom file size arrows be gray.
    * combine status bar and titlebar with left side as file path, right side with file size, directory size, free space; all on the bottom.

High Priority {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cron
    * xcape cron not working.

conky
    * mpv
        If the file name is too long (e.g. if X has > Y characters), have it cut off.
    * mpd
        If the song name is too long (e.g. if X has > Y characters), have it cut off.
    * volume: have a keybind to check current volume, or to pop up the display for a few seconds
        Instead of overhead, you can also put it into your panel by the following: have 2 scripts, script A which gets tracked by .conkyrightrc, and script B which pipes what to echo and for how long into script A. for example do in script B echo "echo '^fg(....)'" > script A. then keybind script B with your 4 volumes (up/down/mute/nothing but display) and do a similar one in each.
    * irssi
        Have fnotify grab the whole nick, not just the line, so i see the whole nick of longer truncated names.
    * skype
    * Add clickables into dzen.
    * Right-aligned dzens should be cut off from the left not the right.

mount
    * Get an automounter that doesn't suck.

Android/iPad USB Connection
    * android: shows up on lsusb but not fdisk -l (hence it won't be automounted).
    * ipad: nope.

laptop
    * Way to disable fan, esp. for lectures if it's too loud.

vim
    LaTeX
        * Start external command in background.. needed for compiling and opening pdf files.
        * Allow rubber to compile filenames with spaces.
        * Get error parser (rubber-info) and autobuild.
    Plugins
        * Ctrl-P: get it working.
    * The load last file doesn't really work as intended, but it does load *some* last files.
    * Something weird with having to press the <ENTER> prompt when opening and certain files.

zsh
    * Deletearound not working.
    * Tab completion doesn't work on some commands (e.g. fasd commands).
    * Tab completion menu colors for scp  are wonky/inverted.

}}}
Medium Priority {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

awesome
    * Migrate over.

feh
    * Set maximum size, but not minimum, so you don't see the ugly box for small pictures.
    * Keybind it better.

Firefox
    * 4chanx/pentadactyl: it goes to home if 4chanx doesn't do anything, especially when it's still loading
    * Style MAL and forum CSS.
    * whatcd/torrent-invites: 33% (50 posts,25 rep), 55% (150 posts, 75 rep), browse regularly for bibliotik
    * Better way to integrate my other/mobile bookmarks that's keyboard navigable.
    * Autoopen all tabs on startup.
    * flash: fullscreen toggles away once i hit something else.
    * Display notifications on primary desktop, not HDMI (e.g. download finished, gmail checker notifier, autopager notification of not loading, etc.).

git
    * Learn the other commands so you can do things like rename git commits, add things, etc.

i3
    * ncmcpp reissues for_window occasionally, causing it to focus (which is annoying if you're in the middle of typing and cause ncmpcpp to do something).

irssi
    * Write in color with <C-c>, but this is escape, which toggles nil-vim_mode..
    * Do stuff like /whois, <c-r>, and /nicklist while being able to remove all that text when i no longer want to see it.
        * A status window works for this, but it doesn't include /names. How to?
    * OpenURL: weird error stuff on some urls, and sometimes don't load full url
    * Display some type of % sign when not at bottom of text.

libreoffice
    * Inserted rows have different font/formatting.
        seems to be a problem with current files only. would have to type each row manually to transfer

mpv
    * How to navigate playlist.

ncmpcpp
    * Incremental seek like with mpv.
    * Somehow play everything as the playlist (clear, then add them).
    * If it idles for longer than 10 seconds, have it automatically go to playlist view.
    * Clean up keys.

plex
    * Get the server working.

ranger
    * Set vim as a (read-only) pager so mediainfo can navigate with it.
    * Set up specific file associations, e.g., .json for gvim, .ts for smplayer.
    * Have those console commands (!) automatically be given a space.
    * Learn all the :scout commands.

SD Card
    * Doesn't read it.

Webcam, Mic
    * Get them working.

skype
    * Install.

urxvt
    * Separate ^J and <CR>, so you can bind them in irssi, and not do workarounds in the rest either.
        same for S-spacebar, C-c
    * Fallback japanese font, somehow a little larger similar to gvim's output.
    * urxvt-perls: c-v as paste (eg for irssi), url clicker+keyboard select.

vim
    * Change up colors for terminal vim.
    * Type lime/uushi encodings with ctrl+shift.
    Plugins
        * Anyway to refer to <SID> functions, e.g., Matchit, stuff that don't use <Plug> so you can nnoremap.
        * NERDCommenter: get it to work for random filetypes (.snippets, i3config, etc.).
        * NERDTree: see stuff.
        * SetColors: not sure how to change the runtimepath to ~/.vim/bundle/nil/colors/*.vim. technically, i could always do a symlink.
        * Powerline: change colors for all modes to suit colorscheme
        * Repeat: not working with Surround.
        * Snippets: Fix the auto-reload command to not be so computation heavy.
        *  How to do snippets inside a snippet? Or perhaps manage more carefully if not.
        * YankStack: not cycling all the time, never cycling when I paste, screws a shitload of my vimrc behavior.

zsh
    * Hind cleaner format for ls -l in terminal.
    * Better ls and grep colors, and better ls style.
    * Have it autoopen files that arent commands in the respective application (e.g. gvim, mplayer, etc).
    * Display the red dots while waiting for long commands as well, e.g., cp large files, pl, etc.
    * Make zle widget for 's/S' as your insert char function
    * When pressing <CR> while still in cmd mode (green), the directory stays the cmd-color. I would like the color to reset back to the default (red) before <CR> is hit, so that it's /always/ the default (red) unless I'm in cmd mode (blue).

}}}
Low Priority {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Audio
    * Can't change volume with alsamixer and usb DAC; i can change all volumes in their own app save for ncmpcpp's.
    mpd
        * set udev rule on headphone jack into amp
            changes audio-source to headphones if i plugged in, monitor if i plugged out (and if monitor not there, then last resort as laptop)
            pkill mpd    mpd ~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf &    mpdas &

laptop vs laptop+external
    * Add script that changes all to [L+E] if connected, and [L] all if disconnected. add a line in hdmi.rules.

i3
    * Set all firefox popups to float more generally, rather than needing to xprop each individually.
        * Read up on no-startup-id.
    * Somehow move the next libreoffice window to the succeeding workspace (iii, iv, v,...) depending on whether there's already a window in that workspace.
    * Switch audios on hotplug without requiring restart applications, and distinct volumes on each, whilst still allowing for just three buttons (a pulseaudio solution).

irssi
    * Set adv_windowlist so that all the channels are only on one line, and the middles get ellipses, like browser tabs.
    * List top channels and sort by name or # users
    * See ban list of channels like in hexchat.
    * Set -> mode so that when you do something like +ao, it only shows the designated nick once, not twice.
    * OpenURL: never lose focus when opening url and firefox is on a focused workspace.
    * <C-v> not pasting (a urxvt issue).
    * vim_mode: Have yank/paste go to the clipboard.
    * Learn how to navigate between different server msgs/queries.
    * anames: Add a bunch of whitespace to the first column.
    * anames: spacing goes crazy if there's a user with a long name.
    * vim_mode: Remove that annoying operator shit, or append it to the right like in vim.
    * pubmsg_me shows one extra character for long names, i.e., when i'm highlighted.

vim
    LaTeX
        * Configure inoreabbrev,snippets,surround instead of in-LaTeX macros.
            Which ones should be via LaTeX and others via vim?
        * Check out surround's macros for auto-completing text like 'div id=' but when you don't want to include an id, it takes it away from the tab.
        * Later, when you deal with LaTeX plugins, try the IDE stuff like SuperTab.
    * Option for "resize" mode of windows, like with i3.
    * Make InsertCharFunction() an atomic operator, e.g., '.'-able.
    * C-o and C-p (C-I) not really working as intended. Have it so that it jumps around only in the current file, not whereever.
        * Stuff about jump lists vs normal motion.
    * Jump to paragraphs? One that includes <br><br> for html.
    * Clear error (one great use of this would be for folding so it doesn't output errors when none exists.
    * Enter url function.
    * If in same workspace as another Vim file, somehow combine the two into one Vim window, with it split.
    * Reloading vim doesn't work for everything, namely newly omitted mappings and settings.
    * Fix $...$ in case there are none.
    * Have cursor position returned to exact position (i.e. column) not just line position.
    * The "jump to next/last sentence" doesn't always work as intended.
    * vim fold text styling. donri is coming up with a plugin for a nice one.

zsh
    * Reopen last closed client/application/window function.
        * E.g., it logs all the processes that disappear, and then it opens up the last line.
        * Some smart WMs can already do this: gnome-shell already keeps track of what windows belong to
            which app (in the sense of /usr/share/applications)
    * All keybind/vim stuff lost during ssh session, wonky prompt.
    * Ctrl-I Doesn't work; also need a good keybind for it.

Misc {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

set up github old dotfiles repo, and firefox styles repo
terminal decorations
    pipes, matrix-y shit, dna, cowsay and variants, space invaders, game of life.
grub
    rename menu entries
laptop
    battery saving implementations, though my battery is at 67% full and laptop is dying anyways
login manager
    boot into X as normally, but first overlayed by a floating terminal asking for password; if fail, then repeat ask, with prompt saying that 'reboot' and 'poweroff' as passwords work; if success, then resume normally. And then whenever I close/open the lid, it does that same terminal function.
    I can issue that close/open lid condition using acpid.
system
    have time sync faster on boot
    recheck and sync the keys and colors on all apps; clean their configs
    purge of all system dotfiles from old packages
    complete wish/todolists.txt
    place all dotfiles into .config! (while removing their '.')
Master: linux (coreultis, ssh/scp, curl, wget, systemd, udev, cron), zsh, vim, irssi.
    see 'devices' for other mastery apps to do
Keyboard Layout: Tutorials.
    L/R Shift training wheels, finger optimizing (e.g. 'rf').
    B&D Colemak&HHKB Style.

Random Shit {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    - Always leave some version of firefox and libreoffice in the background in order to take away any startup.
    - A backup of your system, as well as a perfect sync into a bootable USB on-the-go.
        1. An automated backup of your entire system and config files without superfluous backups of media material.
        2. Moreover, can be used as a carry-around USB which literally boots into your system with everything perfectly set in place.
        3. Have anything changed on the carry-around USB organized into one single folder, for which you can then take it and implement it into your desktop system at later points.
        4. Have the carry-around USB and desktop system config continuously sync, rather than daily.
        1/2. rsync your entire system save for the superfluous material (media folders, etc.).
        3. Don't know yet, but you can always note of this manually.
        4. Don't know yet, but such programs exist.
        -: Do you really need a bootable USB? I mean, it's not like there are just public computers all over the place like some sci-fi place, where instead of owning computers people own little bootable USBs to plug into such hubs as their personal computers on-the-go.
    - Have timestamped backups saved every month, to literally log your life. The only caveat is the huge expense in requiring all that storage. And really, your computer logs just aren't interesting enough to do this..

* something seems really wrong with its read/writing.
    transmission and ranger keep freezing due to external harddrive
    be very skimpy on how you're using the extHD for now, e.g. only read/copy but never download/seed into it
temporary
    downloading everything local for now
    changed mpd dir
    iptorrents: using deluge for the moment, prns and delete .config/deluge afterwards
        use deluge &
    bcg: nothing seeding

* step1: archive videos there and watch
   some skippy playback, hopefully this will smoothen itself out. this seems to be a limitation with the read/writes on usb 2.0, but then again, i was perfectly fine before on linux and windows
   videos freeze entirely on certain portions and corrupt on copy back to new harddrive
        THIS IS THE third time ive lost data on the drive and the second time i reformatted it to ntfs. i need to be more cautious..
            next time: reformat to ntfs, just copy a few videos on it (with full backups), play them back and copy; see if both of these operations work
                this seems to be a physical hard drive problem, since it also has the input/output error when copying files, the thing i was dealing with on ntfs. if it's broken, leave it on ntfs and let someone else play with it from the family to see if it works for them. also tell parents you need to buy another one
step2: move music and library
step3: torrent there (dl and seed) without freezing transmission/ranger and allowing for umount on reboot without having to kill transmission-daemon

possible solutions:
    seagate drive not compatible with ext4, so switch to that weird ambiguous one. i dont see how this is theoretically possible though.
    the drive is physically broken and in disrepair
