# Wishlist:
# * Have the only one running instance add new files with a playlist, not the temp workaround in my scope.sh (also no-fixed-vo doesn't work instead)
# * Don't quit at end of file, i.e., freeze at last frame. --idle idles the terminal command but autocloses the window.
# * For screenshot-template, have the file extension displayed with a - instead of a . Currently,
#   one can only include .filetype or omit it altogether.
# * have 'i' always show the file name, not the media tagged title or the full directory
