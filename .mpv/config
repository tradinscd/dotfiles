# Wishlist:
# * Hotkey that can toggle screen size to 100% and whatever my preferred is.
# * View (and access) list of recently opened files.
# * Have the only one running instance add new files with a playlist, not the temp workaround in my scope.sh (also no-fixed-vo doesn't work instead)
# * When at end of file, freeze at last frame instead of a blackout that keep-open does. It does this on some files but not all. Somehow mandate this.
# * For screenshot-template, have the file extension displayed with a - instead of a . Currently,
#   one can only include .filetype or omit it altogether.
# * have 'i' always show the file name, not the media tagged title or the full directory
