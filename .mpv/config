# Wishlist:
# * Negative subtitle delays seem to do the same as positive ones (see [a-s] ouran 14 release for what I tried it on).
# * Hotkey that can toggle screen size to 100% and whatever my preferred is.
# * View (and access) list of recently opened files.
# * Have the only one running instance add new files with a playlist, not the temp workaround in my scope.sh (also no-fixed-vo doesn't work instead)
# * Don't quit at end of file, i.e., freeze at last frame. --idle idles the terminal command but autocloses the window.
# * For screenshot-template, have the file extension displayed with a - instead of a . Currently,
#   one can only include .filetype or omit it altogether.
# * have 'i' always show the file name, not the media tagged title or the full directory
