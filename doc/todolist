This is a document which compiles a list of tasks that I still have to complete. This is purely for personal (and
 documented) use, so I can keep track of features I desire and when I complete them.

Each to-do item for an application is assigned toward a priority level depending on how much I personally want them to be
 implemented. Then in the Priority categories, each application is sorted by alphabetical order. Then each item for an
 application is itself ranked by descending order of subpriority.

Highest Priority {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Awesome
    * Shift centered floating windows relative, e.g., down and/or to the left, for applications like mpv.
    * Move mouse to center of screen of new focused tag.
        Do something like switchtotag in the keybinds.
    * Applications not shifting correctly between monitors and #s.

    * Maybe change all applications to sizes from awesome instead, i.e., feh in rifle.conf.
    * Bashets: Apply if conditions from a grep, so that all colors and formatting works correctly.
        mpd: stopped
        battery: low
    * Have the tag icons turn sideways on focus.
        Find how to change tag name when focused.
        Find the appropriate icons.
    * mpv: Somehow grep with regexp and gray any parts of the filenames in [...]
    * Get nu on workspaces and layout icon only. Lemon the rest (widgets and menu).
    * Dropdown widgets using Naughty/dzen/whatever: Calendar, Music Now Playing, all the widgets!
    * Try rodentbane for mouse movement with keyobard.

    * Not distinguishing the sizes for other dialogs of calibre-ebook-viewer.

Theme
    * Change theme to a dark filtered one with a kawaii coffee girl/book or some shit. I'm getting tired of flowers.
        Follow ricing guide.

Some Issues
    Awesome
        * Weird freezing where application works but everything can't be given focus although they're still running. This seems to happen most during downloading. Perhaps a problem because of dhcpccd/netctl?
            It seems to be taking its toll once I due to transmission bandwidth. Is this specific to transmission or when I use too much internet in general?
    * cron: cron-mpdas doesn't seem to run in the background; hopefully does this matter?
    * Glitches when moving to firefox sometimes.

mpv
    * Does >/< across multiple directories?
    * Should I add a kill mpv + mpv-open option? Should I add focus?

pentadactyl
    * Somehow always have backups of pentadactyl.txt in case I close it when window no longer exists (hence losing all my text edits).

work-related
    * When redoing pdf, zathura doesn't reload unless I move the page a bit; same happens for rubber or pdflatex.
    * Vim: LaTeX: Autobuild.
        First, need to be able to compile in background. But & fails for both pdflatex and rubber?
    * awesome starts a little too early, not getting wallpaper every time
    * urxvt open commands not working
    Matlab
        * Vim mode?
    * R: default settings, vim mode?

}}}
High Priority {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Android/iPad USB Connection
    * android: shows up on lsusb but not fdisk -l (hence it won't be automounted).
    * ipad: nope.

Awesome
    * Make widgets that only appear on a keybind that moves them, e.g., volume widget (see user-contributed widgets for ex.).
    * Everything not moved right on startup (e.g., transmission-cli, calendar (which has a different startup position depending on the workspace, lol), etc.).
    * Revamp menu, all with cute icons.
    * Somehow move the next libreoffice window to the succeeding workspace (iii, iv, v,...) depending on whether there's already a window in that workspace. For example, pgrep the # of currently running and assign accordingly.
        Do the same for zathura and feh.
    * On top ain't working as I want it to.
        Set Library on top of Firefox always.
    * When mpv changes to another file on its playlist and is at a different resolution. Have it recenter/position again.
    Panel Scripts
        * mpv
            If the file name is too long (e.g. if X has > Y characters), have it cut off.
        * mpd
            If the song name is too long (e.g. if X has > Y characters), have it cut off.
            Have keybind which shows albumart which is not locally stored but always taken from the web via audioscrobbler.
        * volume: have a keybind to check current volume, or to pop up the display for a few seconds
            Instead of overhead, you can also put it into your panel by the following: have 2 scripts, script A which gets tracked by .conkyrightrc, and script B which pipes what to echo and for how long into script A. for example do in script B echo "echo '^fg(....)'" > script A. then keybind script B with your 4 volumes (up/down/mute/nothing but display) and do a similar one in each.
        * Right-aligned panel widgets should be cut off from the left not the right.
    * Can't fullscreen VirtualBox, even with the function.

Compton
    * Somehow shadow-exclude all fullscreen windows, but no longer when they're floating.

cron
    * Do I still need an xcape cronjob?

Firefox Addon: Pentadactyl
    * Using digits autogoes to a url page. stahp. let them use google.
    * Google search suggestions aren't working. unless i specifically go to 'g'.
    * Have '/' searches show the # of results.
    * When I try to hit a popup X box, the status line shifts everything up, then it shifts it down and so it goes screwy in a loop, making it hard to hit the box.

irssi
    * Configure BNC.
        How to deal with playback buffer? Show it right away (for the log and for current viewing) or have it disabled until i msg the bot? How does it manage massive logs when I was gone for, e.g., days?
    * Quitting with /away doesn't show away in sb although I'm still away.
    * Possibly use (status) at login, which you can then close afterwards, so you don't have to deal with all that garbage on login. Or maybe (msgs) too.

Laptop
    * Way to disable fan, esp. for lectures if it's too loud.

mount
    * Get an automounter that doesn't suck.

ranger
    * If scope shows preview and cuts off filename where <50% Of filename is shown, don't have it show a preview.

Vim
    * Make or use some syntax file for your todolists.
    * VimEnter on auto-open last file makes manpager wonky, but wouldn't work with GUIEnter.
    * NERDTree: Get movement keys working, e.g., <C-j>/<C-k>.

xinitrc
    * tcli not starting up, even if I put it in rc.lua. It seems to take a while for transmission-daemon to load? What??

zsh
    * Deletearound not working.
    * Tab completion doesn't work on some commands (e.g. fasd, git).

Work Method
    * Finish a final draft.

}}}
Medium Priority {{{

    * When clicking away from menu, have it hide just like it does with Escape.
    * Eminent mouse scroll through tags not working.
    * Use all variable names in rc.lua so that the theme.lua becomes modular and determines all your colors, e.g., see ahoka.
    * Have alt+hjkl move correspodingly for floating windows, not just counter or clockwise.
    * Hide cursor if it doesn't move for >=5 seconds.
    * Configure Gimp so that the main application is tiled, and the toolbars are floating always on top.
    * erm, that dropbox notification. Modify it.
    Panel Scripts
        Bashets font: err, it sucks on playing japanese/fallbacks. use fallback fonts.
        * battery: On single digit %, it also shows the comma.
        * irssi
            Have fnotify grab the whole nick, not just the line, so i see the whole nick of longer truncated names.
                Also, if that person's nick is long enough, it may connect with his/her nick mode, which causes the script to grab the wrong word to display.
        * skype
        * Add clickables (or keybindables?) into dzen.
    * When youtube video is a url in firefox, have play-pause cycle pause that, not mpv or ncmpcpp instead.

Firefox Addon: Pentadactyl
    * Have searches show # of hits.
    * Better font to distinguish upper cases in hint mode.

    * Do stuff like /whois, <c-r>, and /nicklist while being able to remove all that text when i no longer want to see it.
    * A status window works for this, but it doesn't include /names. How to?
    * Display some type of % sign when not at bottom of text.

skype
    * Install.

trash-cli
    * Delete trash things for external hard drives.
    * Have it show other properties, such as file size.

urxvt
    * Change urxvt settings without requiring to restart application.
    * Separate ^J and <CR>, so you can bind them in irssi, and not do workarounds in the rest either.
        same for S-spacebar, C-c
    * urxvt-perls: c-v as paste (eg for irssi), url clicker+keyboard select.

    * It renders emdashes with a gray..?

vim
    * Change up colors for terminal vim.

    * NERDCommenter: get it to work for random filetypes (.snippets, i3config, etc.).

    * Snippets: Fix the auto-reload command to not be so computation heavy.
    * Snippets: How to do snippets inside a snippet? Or perhaps manage more carefully if not.
    * YankStack: not cycling all the time, never cycling when I paste, screws a shitload of my vimrc behavior.
    * vim fold text styling. donri is coming up with a plugin for a nice one.

zsh
    * Make cleaner format for ls -l in terminal.
    * Better ls and grep colors, and better ls style.

    * Display the red dots while waiting for long commands as well, e.g., cp large files, pl, etc.
    * Make zle widget for 's/S' as your insert char function
    * When pressing <CR> while still in cmd mode (green), the directory stays the cmd-color. I would like the color to reset back to the default (red) before <CR> is hit, so that it's /always/ the default (red) unless I'm in cmd mode (blue).

}}}
Low Priority {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

audio-output
    * Don't require restarting applications, e.g., mpd, firefox, but don't force-kill and restart them.

Audio
    * Can't change volume with alsamixer and usb DAC; i can change all volumes in their own app save for ncmpcpp's.
    mpd
        * set udev rule on headphone jack into amp
            changes audio-source to headphones if i plugged in, monitor if i plugged out (and if monitor not there, then last resort as laptop)
            pkill mpd    mpd ~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf &    mpdas &

Awesome
    * irssi-notify doesn't echo the nick if it starts with 'nil'. Lolwat.
    * alt+shift hjkl to move floating window.
    * Do modal keybindings, so you can effectively keybind hjkl and move through tiling windows more effectively than having ones only go to resizing.

Firefox Addon: Pentadactyl
    * normal <C-j> goes to home page if it's assigned to do nothing else at that issue of command, e.g., if it's unbinded, for example, in 4chan thread pages.
    * g not always working on reddit
    * $ not working in google
    * Function to tabdetach if there's not a 2nd Firefox window, tabattach to the other window if there is (this compounds 3 keys into one (:taba 1,:taba 2,:tabd).
    * Jumps in same buffer without changing pages. (same problem in Vim)
    * set tabmove to move to 1st position, if it's already in last position (similarly for first to last)

irssi
    * Some way to highlight all text, so you can see text underneath spoilers without requiring to use mouse.
    * Set vim_mode command to open corresponding log of the current channel in vim, so you can browse through the log.
    * Pubmsghighlight, e.g., "text + highlight", have an extra letter in their names.
    * Set adv_windowlist so that all the channels are only on one line, and the middles get ellipses, like browser tabs.
    * Alias to list top 10-20 channels and sort by name or # users.
    * See ban list of channels like in hexchat.
    * Set -> mode so that when you do something like +ao, it only shows the designated nick once, not twice.
    * OpenURL: never lose focus when opening url and firefox is on a focused workspace.
    * <C-v> not pasting (a urxvt issue).
    * vim_mode: Have yank/paste go to the clipboard.
    * anames: Add a bunch of whitespace to the first column.
    * anames: spacing goes crazy if there's a user with a long name.
    * vim_mode: Remove that annoying operator shit, or append it to the right like in vim.
    * pubmsg_me shows one extra character for long names, i.e., when i'm highlighted.

ranger
    * Add a :zip command that does as desired.
    * Have those console commands (!) automatically be given a space.
    * Learn all the :scout commands.
    * Prevent certain things from causing ranger window to blink for really quick output, e.g., atool unpacking or emptying trash, if they're shorter than half a second.

urxvt
    * Fallback japanese fonts still render some blurry.

vim
    Airline: Add an arrow to filename, and reformat the +.
    Airline: Customize how it handles statuslines on inactive windows, e.g., nerd or another.
    Airline: change color of middle bar to a lighter white.
    LaTeX
        * Configure inoreabbrev,snippets,surround instead of in-LaTeX macros.
            Which ones should be via LaTeX and others via vim?
        * Check out surround's macros for auto-completing text like 'div id=' but when you don't want to include an id, it takes it away from the tab.
        * Later, when you deal with LaTeX plugins, try the IDE stuff like SuperTab.
    * Option for "resize" mode of windows, like with i3.
    * Make InsertCharFunction() an atomic operator, e.g., '.'-able.
    * C-o and C-p (C-I) not really working as intended. Have it so that it jumps around only in the current file, not whereever.
        * Stuff about jump lists vs normal motion.
    * Jump to paragraphs? One that includes <br><br> for html.
    * Clear error (one great use of this would be for folding so it doesn't output errors when none exists).
    * If in same workspace as another Vim file, somehow combine the two into one Vim window, with it split.
    * Reloading vim doesn't work for everything, namely newly omitted mappings and settings.
    * Fix $...$ in case there are none.
    * Have cursor position returned to exact position (i.e. column) not just line position.
    * The "jump to next/last sentence" doesn't always work as intended. Do them better, along with paragraph.
    * Load multiple files so you can <C-e> right away.

zathura
    * When Page Uping midway on first page, go to top. Analogous for Page down on last page.

zsh
    * All keybind/vim stuff lost during ssh session, wonky prompt.
    * Tab completion menu colors for scp  are wonky/inverted.
    * Maybe use vim, or at least vim buffer navigation, when I do --help and I the output suggestions are larger than the buffer.

laptop
    battery saving implementations, though my battery is at 67% full and laptop is dying anyways
login manager
    boot into X as normally, but first overlayed by a floating terminal asking for password; if fail, then repeat ask, with prompt saying that 'reboot' and 'poweroff' as passwords work; if success, then resume normally. And then whenever I close/open the lid, it does that same terminal function.  I can issue that close/open lid condition using acpid.
Look at other people's dotfiles in github for ideas.
system
    Optimize boot time.
    Recheck and sync the keys and colors on all apps; clean their configs.
    Purge all system dotfiles from old packages and/or reinstall.
    Complete wish/todolists.
    Place all dotfiles into .config! (while removing their '.')
Learn all them linux commands, archlinux niche functions, etc.

Random Shit {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- A backup of your system, as well as a perfect sync into a bootable USB on-the-go.
    1. An automated backup of your entire system and config files without superfluous backups of media material.
    2. Moreover, can be used as a carry-around USB which literally boots into your system with everything perfectly set in place.
    3. Have anything changed on the carry-around USB organized into one single folder, for which you can then take it and implement it into your desktop system at later points.
    4. Have the carry-around USB and desktop system config continuously sync, rather than daily.
    1/2. rsync your entire system save for the superfluous material (media folders, etc.).
    3. Don't know yet, but you can always note of this manually.
    4. Don't know yet, but such programs exist.
    -: Do you really need a bootable USB? I mean, it's not like there are just public computers all over the place like some sci-fi place, where instead of owning computers people own little bootable USBs to plug into such hubs as their personal computers on-the-go.
- Have timestamped backups saved every month, to literally log your life. The only caveat is the huge expense in requiring all that storage. And really, your computer logs just aren't interesting enough to do this..
