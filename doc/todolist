This is a document which compiles a list of tasks that I still have to complete. This is purely for personal (and
 documented) use, so I can keep track of features I desire and when I complete them.

Each to-do item for an application is assigned toward a priority level depending on how much I personally want them to be
 implemented. Then in the Priority categories, each application is sorted by alphabetical order. Then each item for an
 application is itself ranked by descending order of subpriority.

misc
    firefox popups too big
    vim: uushi not working
    deal with window layout, e.g., the media
    move skype with the rule_any thing
    emdash/alt
    Clean packages/my PC's memory

mpd
    in the alias, set if statement of it mpdas defunct/not there, add mpdas & line too

Awesome
    *** Fix mail-notify!!
        Weird freezing where application works but everything can't be given focus although they're still running. This seems to happen most during downloading. Perhaps a problem because of dhcpccd/netctl?
        This happens because of mail-notify while it's using up bandwidth. Is this in conjunction with transmission running? Why would it stall the PC apps if it just takes up time to finish?
    * Shift centered floating windows relative, e.g., down and/or to the left, for applications like mpv.
    * Move mouse to center of screen of new focused tag.
        Do something like switchtotag in the keybinds.
    * Applications not shifting correctly between monitors and #s, what with absolute positions. Maybe add movetoscreeen or something? see mod4+control+j function in the default rc.lua and add it to your keybinds

Colemak
    * convert: vim (nerdtree, bufexplorer)
    * scrolling up/down in docs, e.g., r doc
    * Re-arrange any keybinds (e.g. dealing with ctrl s across multiple applications).

cron
   * Fix the cronjobs. mpdas simply goes defunct. Fails on reboot. Perhaps add an if condition that stipulates to run it if it says <defunct>. rssdler isn't always downloading

vim
    * syntax color style for my todolist, and a file that logs when I add and complete (delete) tasks

urxvt
    * urxvt-perls: c-v as paste (eg for irssi and readline), url clicker+keyboard select.

}}}
High Priority {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Android USB Connection
    * shows up on lsusb but not fdisk -l

Awesome
    Appearance
        * Bashets: Apply if conditions from a grep, so that all colors and formatting works correctly.
            mpd: stopped
            battery: low
        * Have the tag icons turn sideways on focus.
            Find how to change tag name when focused.
            Find the appropriate icons.
        * mpv: Somehow grep with regexp and gray any parts of the filenames in [...] maybe by sedding them and adding the separator variable.
        * Get nu on workspaces and layout icon only. Lemon the rest (particularly the menu).
        * Dropdown widgets using Naughty/dzen/whatever: Calendar, Music Now Playing, all the widgets!
    General
        * Have the directional focusings go across monitors too.
        * Make widgets that only appear on a keybind that moves them, e.g., volume widget (see user-contributed widgets for ex.).
            * have battery widget show ETA on hover
        * Everything not moved right on startup (e.g., transmission-cli, calendar (which has a different startup position depending on the workspace, lol), etc.).
        * Revamp menu, all with cute icons.
        * Somehow move the next libreoffice window to the succeeding workspace (iii, iv, v,...) depending on whether there's already a window in that workspace. For example, pgrep the # of currently running and assign accordingly.
            Do the same for zathura and feh.
        * Set alt+o to not do "on top", but to focus window that's below it, which would then put it on top.
            Set Library on top of Firefox always.
        * When mpv changes to another file on its playlist and is at a different resolution. Have it recenter/position again.
        * For things like gimp, have the extra dialog folders show appropriately on the right workspace (this includes the right monitor). For example, GIMP's save dialog appears on my external display.
    Panel Scripts
        * mpv
            If the file name is too long (e.g. if X has > Y characters), truncate it.
        * mpd
            If the song name is too long (e.g. if X has > Y characters), truncate it.
            Have keybind which shows albumart which is not locally stored but always taken from the web via audioscrobbler.
        * volume: have a keybind to check current volume, or to pop up the display for a few seconds
            Instead of overhead, you can also put it into your panel by the following: have 2 scripts, script A which gets tracked by .conkyrightrc, and script B which pipes what to echo and for how long into script A. for example do in script B echo "echo '^fg(....)'" > script A. then keybind script B with your 4 volumes (up/down/mute/nothing but display) and do a similar one in each.
        * Right-aligned panel widgets should be cut off from the left not the right.
    Misc
        * Can't fullscreen VirtualBox, even with the function.
        * Not distinguishing the sizes for other dialogs of calibre-ebook-viewer.
        * If I can't set feh to change only if bigger than X size like mpv can, then set the feh settings in awesome instead of rifle.conf.
        * Try rodentbane for the occasionally necessary mouse movement with keyboard.
        * Add left+right click as move window.

cron
    * Get up an xcape cronjob. It still goes funky at times.

Firefox Addon: Pentadactyl
    * Using digits autogoes to a url page. stahp. let them use google.
    * Google search suggestions aren't working. unless i specifically go to 'g'.
    * Have '/' searches show the # of results.
    * When I try to hit a popup X box, the status line shifts everything up, then it shifts it down and so it goes screwy in a loop, making it hard to hit the box.

irssi
    * better way to store logs, so you dont see things like truncated names
    * include invisible (status) channel so it collects all commands like /names
    * Quitting with /away doesn't show away in sb on new login, although I'm still away.
    * Possibly use (status) at login, which you can then close afterwards, so you don't have to deal with all that garbage on login. Or maybe (msgs) too.
    * Alias > to automatically expand to C-c3>.

media-catalog
    * Have 2001 Space Odyssey after everything in sort, not before [ characters.
    * Automate this: Don't include [Backlog] subfolders and but do include them if they start with [...], like [Completed] and [Summer 2013].
        I've worked around this for now by echo'ing them directly from the .zshrc command.
    * Specify up to levels for certain things, to avoid massive musics for instance
        I have to delete them manually for now.

mpv-open
    * occasionally getting these weird blank sed files in ~/.mpv.

mpv
    * Does >/< across multiple directories?
    * Should I add a kill mpv + mpv-open option in rifle.conf? Should I make mpv auto-focus?
    * Stream youtube into here.

pentadactyl
    * Better way to deal with bookmarks..
    * Somehow always have backups of pentadactyl.txt in case I close it when window no longer exists (hence losing all my text edits).

ranger
    * If scope shows preview and cuts off filename where <50% Of filename is shown, don't have it show a preview.
    * mpv-open: Sometimes it doesn't work? Maybe have ranger show the error if it doesn't open.

readline
    * Matlab: Add.
    * Change less pager to vim, e.g., for R.
    * matlab: Hide welcome/copyright/version message via tail output.
    * Add color to inputs of python, R, Matlab to determine what mode you're in.
    * Add more vim keybindings like ones I did for zle widgets. Possibly even sync the two.
        Use github for suggestions.

skype/mic
    * usb audio output should always be set to 50. it resets. putting it in udev-hdmi is not the right way since you only put up the usb when about to speak
        amixer -c 2 set Mic 9dB
    * enable push to talk
    * some configuration to enable user to see who talks in a group
    * awesome: Configure where to place it.
    * awesome: how to deal with notifications.

transmission
    * Occasionally corrupt pieces of files in Transmission downloading. Is this transmission's fault or mine??
        For now, you'll have to check each torrent after it finishes individually.

Vim
    * latex $..$ not working anymore.
    * Fix 'df' and 'ct' (basically omap) til-ing.
    * Note that you uncommented that one part from NERDCommenter.vim.
    * Make or use some syntax file for your todolists.
    * NERDTree: Get movement keys working, e.g., <C-j>/<C-k>.

udev-hdmi
    * awesome starts a little too early, not getting wallpaper every time, especially if I try to open apps.
    * urxvt open commands not working.

virtualbox
    * Err, Windows 8 died on me.

xinitrc
    * tcli not starting up, even if I put it in rc.lua. It seems to take a while for transmission-daemon to load? What??

Zathura
    * keybind for fullscreen
    * When redoing pdf, zathura doesn't reload unless I move the page a bit; same happens for rubber or pdflatex.
    * Have <Leader><Space> turn off the highlight, not just Esc.

zsh
    * Deletearound not working.
    * Tab completion doesn't work on some commands (e.g. fasd, git).

Misc
    * Change theme to a dark filtered one with a kawaii coffee girl/book or some shit. I'm getting tired of flowers.
        Follow ricing guide.
    * Automate the following
        * Unmounting: pkill ranger (sometimes); pause all torrents in transmission-client; pkill mpd; umountb
        * Mounting: mountb; unpause all torrents in transmission-client; mpd (the alias); mpdas &
    * Fork transmissionremotecli properly so people can use your own more professionally
    * WorkMethod: Finish final draft.
    * latex: what's with the .out files? why rubber no clean??

Medium Priority {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

laptop
    optimize battery with CPU frequency scaling and stuff

Awesome
    * Maybe use nicer looking pngs for the icons, e.g., Ahoka or Lemonboy's.
    * When clicking away from menu, have it hide just like it does with Escape.
    * Use all variable names in rc.lua so that the theme.lua becomes modular and determines all your colors, e.g., see ahoka.
    * Hide cursor if it doesn't move for >=5 seconds.
    * Configure Gimp so that the main application is tiled, and the toolbars are floating always on top.
    Panel Scripts
        Bashets font: err, it sucks on playing japanese/fallbacks. use fallback fonts.
        * battery: On single digit %, it also shows the comma.
        * irssi
            Have fnotify grab the whole nick, not just the line, so i see the whole nick of longer truncated names.
                Also, if that person's nick is long enough, it may connect with his/her nick mode, which causes the script to grab the wrong word to display.
        * skype
        * Add clickables (or keybindables?) into dzen.
    * When youtube video is a url in firefox, have play-pause cycle pause that, not mpv or ncmpcpp instead.

feh
    * Set maximum size, but not minimum, so you don't see the ugly box for small pictures.

Firefox
    * MAL: Set up wikipedia+MAL API so that you can autoadd all tags.
    * whatcd: get power user (1.05 ratio) for ptp, btn, and bibilotik invites
    * Better way to integrate my other/mobile bookmarks that's keyboard navigable.
    * flash: fullscreen toggles away once i hit something else.
    * Display notifications on primary desktop, not HDMI (e.g. download finished, gmail checker notifier, autopager notification of not loading, etc.).
    * Don't have middle click on webpage go to last opened tab.
    * Screen glitches when moving to firefox sometimes.

Firefox Addon: Pentadactyl
    * Have searches show # of hits.
    * Better font to distinguish upper cases in hint mode.

irssi
    * Get a way to set a vim mode map to do "3 ", and another for "1,1 "
    * Do stuff like /whois, <c-r>, ,n and /nicklist while being able to remove all that text when i no longer want to see it.
    * A status window works for this, but it doesn't include /names. How to?
    * Display some type of % sign when not at bottom of text.
    * Do nick/vhosts/BNC for all servers.
    * IRC: SSL cerificate path and SSL_verify.

mcomix
    * have right click show osd-bar as in mpv, but how else to do context menu?

mpv
    * Configure autosync to never go out during fast forward, e.g., with --mc or whatever.

media-lists
    * figure out how to sort, e.g., pull out from a section and place into a file, and have sed sort by every 7th row or something

ncmpcpp
    * Somehow play everything as the playlist (clear, then add them).
    * Get progress bar elapsed color to work.
    * Incremental seek like with mpv.
    * If it idles for longer than 10 seconds, have it automatically go to playlist view.
    * Clean up keys.

plex
    * Get the server working.

ranger
    * Have the l keybind for unpack work on multiply selected items, doing it sequentially.
    * Set it to auto-open last directory as hut stated in the Q&A.
    * Set djvu to not show any preview.
    * Set vim as a (read-only) pager so mediainfo can navigate with it.
    * When using Dt to see trash list, have it ask if you want to clear the trash list also.
    * When renaming, allow some way to already have the current name to modify (e.g., when trying to rename long file names but only a portion of it).

transmission-remote-cli
    * Set default download location setting.
    * Add better documentation in help messages.
    * Can't see cursor anymore when typing, e.g., moving location of file.
    * Have a keybind that sets all active downloads/seeding (basically, non-paused) to the bottom of queue position. And even more advanced, have those ones all sorted by completion rather than arbitrarily. E.g., Seeds above, then highest % downloads sorted descending. Also consider automating this on entering tcli.

ranger
    * Make pdfs and djvus the same color.
    * Don't have it preview .srts, which makes it when browsing through a list of movies with .srts each to them.
    * When mounting extHD while with ranger up and shown the empty links already, have it load and preview them without requiring restart.

trash-cli
    * Delete trash things for external hard drives.
    * Have it show other properties, such as file size.

urxvt
    * Change urxvt settings without requiring to restart application.
    * Separate ^J and <CR>, so you can bind them in irssi, and not do workarounds in the rest either.
        same for S-spacebar, C-c
    * what is this alt+s urxvtperl business with scrollback? can i use it for searching, especially in irssi/terminal?
    * Make sure all the fallback weeaboo fonts work.

vim
    * Use different fonts for different languages, e.g., similar to how urxvt has fallback font.
    * LaTeX: Autobuild.
        First, need to be able to compile in background. But & fails for both pdflatex and rubber?
    * If in .Rtex file, have the autobuild but also have same syntax highlighting as .tex.
        !R -e "library(knitr); knit('%:p')"
        !rubber -d "%:r".tex
        silent !rubber --clean "%:r".tex &
        * If I can't do this and am relying on R code, just have Vim not try to auto-compile .Rtex.
    * Change up colors for terminal vim.
    * Type lime/uushi encodings with ctrl+shift.
    * Anyway to refer to <SID> functions, e.g., Matchit, stuff that don't use <Plug> so you can nnoremap.
    * NERDCommenter: get it to work for random filetypes (.snippets, i3config, etc.).
    * SetColors: not sure how to change the runtimepath to ~/.vim/bundle/nil/colors/*.vim. technically, i could always do a symlink.
    * Repeat: Not working with Surround.
    * Snippets: Fix the auto-reload command to not be so computation heavy.
    * Snippets: How to do snippets inside a snippet? Or perhaps manage more carefully if not.
    * YankStack: not cycling all the time, never cycling when I paste, screws a shitload of my vimrc behavior.
    * vim fold text styling. donri is coming up with a plugin for a nice one.

Zathura
    * Keybind >/< to go through all possible readable documents within that directory.
    * Maybe some to go up/down directories too. I don't need anything too fancy; just these four shortcuts are good enough.

zsh
    * Make cleaner format for ls -l in terminal.
    * Better ls and grep colors, and better ls style.
    * Have it autoopen files that arent commands in the respective application (e.g. gvim, mplayer, etc).
    * Display the red dots while waiting for long commands as well, e.g., cp large files, pl, etc.
    * Make zle widget for 's/S' as your insert char function
    * When pressing <CR> while still in cmd mode (green), the directory stays the cmd-color. I would like the color to reset back to the default (red) before <CR> is hit, so that it's /always/ the default (red) unless I'm in cmd mode (blue).

}}}
Low Priority {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

audio-output
    * Don't require restarting applications, e.g., mpd, firefox, but don't force-kill and restart them.

Audio
    * Can't change volume with alsamixer and usb DAC; i can change all volumes in their own app save for ncmpcpp's.
    mpd
        * set udev rule on headphone jack into amp
            changes audio-source to headphones if i plugged in, monitor if i plugged out (and if monitor not there, then last resort as laptop)
            pkill mpd    mpd ~/.config/mpd/mpd.conf &    mpdas &

Compton
    * Somehow shadow-exclude all fullscreen windows, but no longer when they're floating.

Awesome
    * irssi-notify doesn't echo the nick if it starts with 'nil'. Lolwat.
    * Eminent mouse scroll through tags not working.
    * erm, that dropbox notification. Modify it.

Firefox Addon: Pentadactyl
    * normal <C-j> goes to home page if it's assigned to do nothing else at that issue of command, e.g., if it's unbinded, for example, in 4chan thread pages.
    * g not always working on reddit
    * $ not working in google
    * Function to tabdetach if there's not a 2nd Firefox window, tabattach to the other window if there is (this compounds 3 keys into one (:taba 1,:taba 2,:tabd).
    * Jumps in same buffer without changing pages. (same problem in Vim)
    * set tabmove to move to 1st position, if it's already in last position (similarly for first to last)

irssi
    * Some way to highlight all text, so you can see text underneath spoilers without requiring to use mouse.
    * Set vim_mode command to open corresponding log of the current channel in vim, so you can browse through the log.
    * Pubmsghighlight, e.g., "text + highlight", have an extra letter in their names.
    * Set adv_windowlist so that all the channels are only on one line, and the middles get ellipses, like browser tabs.
    * Alias to list top 10-20 channels and sort by name or # users.
    * See ban list of channels like in hexchat.
    * Set -> mode so that when you do something like +ao, it only shows the designated nick once, not twice.
    * OpenURL: never lose focus when opening url and firefox is on a focused workspace.
    * OpenURL: second+ lines of long urls are not underlined and blued.
    * <C-v> not pasting (a urxvt issue).
    * vim_mode: Have yank/paste go to the clipboard.
    * anames: Add a bunch of whitespace to the first column.
    * anames: spacing goes crazy if there's a user with a long name.
    * vim_mode: Remove that annoying operator shit, or append it to the right like in vim.
    * pubmsg_me shows one extra character for long names, i.e., when i'm highlighted.

mount
    * Get an automounter that doesn't suck.

R
    * knitr Compiling: It works if I don't use \input{}. See if I can do it with \input{}.
       current command works fine but it adds knitr things twice.

ranger
    * Add a :zip command that does as desired.
    * Have those console commands (!) automatically be given a space.
    * Learn all the :scout commands.
    * Prevent certain things from causing ranger window to blink for really quick output, e.g., atool unpacking or emptying trash, if they're shorter than half a second.

urxvt
    * Fallback japanese fonts still render some blurry.

vim
    Airline: Add an arrow to filename, and reformat the +.
    Airline: Customize how it handles statuslines on inactive windows, e.g., nerd or another.
    Airline: change color of middle bar to a lighter white.
    LaTeX
        * Allow to <Tab> between the $..$.
        * Configure inoreabbrev,snippets,surround instead of in-LaTeX macros.
            Which ones should be via LaTeX and others via vim?
        * Check out surround's macros for auto-completing text like 'div id=' but when you don't want to include an id, it takes it away from the tab.
        * Later, when you deal with LaTeX plugins, try the IDE stuff like SuperTab.
    * Option for "resize" mode of windows, like with i3.
    * Make InsertCharFunction() an atomic operator, e.g., '.'-able.
    * C-o and C-p (C-I) not really working as intended. Have it so that it jumps around only in the current file, not whereever.
        * Stuff about jump lists vs normal motion.
    * Jump to paragraphs? One that includes <br><br> for html.
    * Clear error (one great use of this would be for folding so it doesn't output errors when none exists).
    * If in same workspace as another Vim file, somehow combine the two into one Vim window, with it split.
    * Reloading vim doesn't work for everything, namely newly omitted mappings and settings.
    * Fix $...$ in case there are none.
    * Have cursor position returned to exact position (i.e. column) not just line position.
    * The "jump to next/last sentence" doesn't always work as intended. Do them better, along with paragraph.
    * Load multiple files so you can <C-e> right away.

zathura
    * When Page Uping midway on first page, go to top. Analogous for Page down on last page.
    * Manage pdfs with tabs, while with keybinds to detach/attach.

zsh
    * All keybind/vim stuff lost during ssh session, wonky prompt.
    * Tab completion menu colors for scp  are wonky/inverted.
    * Maybe use vim, or at least vim buffer navigation, when I do --help and I the output suggestions are larger than the buffer.
