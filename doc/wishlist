This is a document which compiles a list of features that I would like on various applications I have used. This is mainly
 for personal use, so I can keep track of features I desire.

This is sorted alphabetically by application. Each item on the list is assigned toward a priority level depending how much
 I personally want them to be implemented. Then each item in the Priority categories are themselves ranked in descending
 order of subpriority.

Awesome {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Low Priority
    * Restart awesome without flickering.
    * Resize floating windows without flickering.

}}}
byzanz {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Priority
    * Allow filename to take in timestamps, as scrot does.
    * Allow argument to take a file path, instead of being forced to alias a 'cd ... && byzanz-record ... && cd-' command. This also means menu commands like awesome cannot take a file path, only interactive shells.

Low Priority
    * Capture just one window without needing to specify dimensions.

}}}
Calibre {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Priority
    * More keybinds: Go to Table of Contents, Toggle toolbars, Dictionary type & look up (instead of highlighting then <C-l>).
    * Hint mode to hit links with keypresses.
    * Remove entire GTK interface and leave just the document if desired.

}}}
Firefox Addon: 4chan X Seaweed {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Priority
    * Can't open up thread with keybind 'Open thread in new tab'.
    * Working watch list.
    * Mouse drag-hold adjustable image like RES; better yet, a keyboard adjustable one.
    * Ability to keyboard hint-click replies to posts, or at least hit a keybind that will open them up if they exist.
           'Quote Hash Navigation' can do this partially, but it only moves to that post, not opens up the inline post like the arrow does; also it is prevalent on all quotes, which is unnecessary for this purpose.

Medium Priority
    * Working autopager (this saves two keybinds, is more convenient, and doesn't deal with "should i wait or open new page in tab which requires 2 more keybinds" dilemma).
        Can't navigate to last thread on a board's page (and subsequently keyboard-open its thread).
    * Keybind to open up corresponding archive link to board.

Low Priority
    * Have <C-j>/<C-k> navigate between threads on the board index, and navigate between posts on a thread page (this saves two keybinds since I never nagivate between two posts on the board index).
        At the very least, the ability to unbind c-j/k on comments page, preventing it from going  to home page.
    * When J/K navigating between posts and when hitting K at the top most post, have it deselect (this saves a keybind). This allows you to select the OP and expand his/her image.
    * Have the extra info when hovering over a post be shown when you're selecting it through keyboard navigation, i.e., the image file name, its size and resolution, and the google and iqdb links.

}}}
Firefox Addon: Pentadactyl {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Priority
   * True Bookmark support.
       No -folder option when adding bookmarks through :bmark.
       Better navigation through :bmarks, c.f., through folders with GUI.
       E.g., a url link with all bookmarks with the folders, then i can use the f/F hints to hint the links or the folders.
   * Better native GUI support: Better way to work with recently closed tabs/windows and view them, as well as bunch of "back"'s history, instead of showing Menu Bar and navigating from there.
       Same with history dialog.
   * An actually useful way to nagivate with caret mode. Possibly where caret starts at center of screen instead of wherever. I dunno, something. Right now trying to cp+paste with it is just terrible.
   * Navigate between multiple scrollbars on the same tab, e.g., on feedly.
   * I can't hint links that are popup windows or when the damn hints are off the left border of the screen..
   * I can't hint out of the popup windows, e.g., when editing entries in MAL.

Medium Priority
    * Ability to toggle scrollbar without needing to refresh page in order to see it.
   * Tab Options Plugin: I want it to open tabs at the end if I open a bunch of links, but otherwise to the right of the current "group". This is more intuitive in Chrome which does this automatically.
   * Not clear when I'm in text edit mode during cmd-line, and how to escape it.

Low Priority
   * Check list of back's, in case hitting it once keeps redirecting you instead, or you just want to check something way back.
   * No support for <Leader><Leader> (though <Leader>,> works.

}}}
Firefox Addon: Reddit Enhancement Suite {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Priority
    * Open comments in new (unfocused) tab.
    * Hide child comments, not hide the parent comment as well.
    * Prefetch all images like 4chanx.

Medium Priority
    * Keyboard adjustable image, not just mouse drag-hold adjustable.
    * Refocus frame movement like 4chanx, where if you scroll normally, then start navigating between threads or posts, it automoves that keyboard cursor to whichever ones are seen on your current display.

}}}
i3 {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Things that were still on todolist for it.
Medium Priority
    * ncmcpp reissues for_window occasionally, causing it to focus (which is annoying if you're in the middle of typing and cause ncmpcpp to do something).
Low Priority
    * Set all firefox popups to float more generally, rather than needing to xprop each individually.
        * Read up on no-startup-id.
    * Somehow move the next libreoffice window to the succeeding workspace (iii, iv, v,...) depending on whether there's already a window in that workspace.
    * Switch audios on hotplug without requiring restart applications, and distinct volumes on each, whilst still allowing for just three buttons (a pulseaudio solution).

High Priority
    * Slightly more advanced panel customizability.
        Non-integer order, e.g., alphabetical or UTF-8 icons.
        Different styles for focused workspace, e.g., have them animate, turn sideways, have a triangle instead of turn completely different colors, or do /something/ different.
        Can't add a black outline to the workspace panel. The first workspace icon isn't completely covered when focused this way.
    * Single keybind to spawn app if doesn't exist, focus app if exist. This makes two keybinds in one.
    * When focusing an application and there are multiple hits for that string, cycle among them; don't just stick with the first result.

Medium Priority
    * Slightly more advanced panel customizability.
        Keybindable panel applets, e.g., a now-playing mpd widget with not just hover/click support, but keybind support.
        Image icon/non-UTF name support.
    * Better true panel support for dzen2.
        E.g., don't require so many manual dzen2's depending on separate text alignments.
        E.g., dzen2 in center has weird flickering when moving workspaces in laptop rapidly, while HDMI is in fullscreen on mpv.
        E.g., when restarting, the nondocked dzen2's get overlapped because i3bar restarts.
    * Recall window sizes of things that don't size their own windows (mostly GUIs).
    * Ability to not use borders on non-floating windows, but keep them for manually made floating windows. (And also a
        keybind to be able to toggle that border.)
    * Move between floating windows with hjkl, not just a (counter)clockwise cycle through hl.
       * As a subset, this means I can't move to the next monitor with hl.
    * Execute a shell command when triggered with focusing a window, e.g., remove irssi notification ping once you focus irssi.
    * Prevent certain applications from stealing focus due to it re-issuing the for_window command, ncmpcpp in particular.
    * Modular config files, e.g., having theming parts of config optionally in another file so that you can interchange them easily by citing a different file path to import from in the ~/.config/i3/config file.

Low Priority
    * More instantaneous mouse-over-window focus, rather than require to move further into the window to activate focus.
    * Somehow absolute positioning based off workspace, not pixels and monitor alignment, so plugging out a large external display from a laptop, which forces the workspace onto the laptop, won't have crazy positioning based off the external display's larger resolution.
       for_window [class=asdf] move absolute position 4000 px 300 px works, but is not nice for dynamic monitor management, e.g., if I switch to just the laptop instead of a dual screen setup.
    * Ability to dynamically set the different floating layouts, move (by cycling) the floating windows around, etc.
    * Independent scratchpads, e.g., ability to have multiple overlayed on each other and still
       can toggle hide them all away (can only do one at a time currently).
    * Ability to hide/close floating window on loss of focus (for better use of some scratchpad
       windows, like scratchpad terminals).
    * Right-click desktop with options.
    * When changing workspaces and back, the w3m image preview in ranger is gone.

}}}
irssi {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Priority
    * Integrated search function that highlights the search parameter and scrolls through the buffer for you like a normal <C-f> would in other IRC clients. /lastlog is terrible and outputs all the results, resulting in clunky chat window. Then keybind them with ? and / modes in vim_mode.
        At the very least, some way to open up the current log within vim, and then browse it from there.

Medium Priority
    * Inline embedded images when displaying an image link (in the same way ranger uses w3m).
    * True mouse support, e.g., clickable links (not just (shift+ with mouse.pl)drag+copy), clickable window names, maybe context menus for something.
    * Advanced Window List: Collapse channels to a tab bar much like firefox with a bunch of ellipses and clear answers for the ends.
    * vim_mode: maps with <CR>/<C-j> don't work.

Low Priority
    * Advanced Window List: Ability to condense channel texts from just left to right, instead of cutting down the middle.
    * Advanced Window List: Better centered text than that with the awl_display_header.
    * C-# and C-j as separate keys.
    * OpenURL: Ability for multiple urls in one line.
    * OpenURL: Ability for urls in /me commands.
    * OpenURL: Ability for urls that I post (yes I open my own links heh).
    * uberprompt: show without indicating its status at the beginning. '/prompt set -only $' only works temporarily until I hit another ex command. Would require some more extensive scripting to rid this feature.

}}}
libreoffice {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Priority
    * Modal editing, and keybind navigation a la vim

}}}
mpv {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Priority
    * Internal subtitle rendering quality just like MPC-HC, where the subtitles aren't integrated into the video (and hence blurred on fullscreen), but rather overwritten on top.

Medium Priority:
    Playlist Navigation/Management
        * If no playlist exists, automatically play next file in the same directory (like MPC-HC).
            See https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/issues/132.
        * Better default support for playlist navigation and management.
        * Have only one running instance of mpv where opening other files only add append them to the present playlist (note: no-fixed-vo doesn't do this).
            Luckily my own solution is good enough that I don't care /that/ much about these features.
    * Allow to reduce osd_border_size but without reducing the size of the fangs for the chapter markers.
    * Fast forward/rewind unsyncs audio with video; have to +5/-5 to resync.
    * Let keep-open work if at end of last file, but not prevent say, automatic segwaying into the next file on the playlist. This offers the normal behavior in GUIs: automatic movement into next files in playlists but not closing its application once done playing all files.
    * When at end of file, freeze at last frame instead of a blackout that keep-open does. It does this on some files but not all. Somehow mandate this for those that reach a black screen.
    * Compound commands don't work for everything. Luckily, I can cheat/work around this by making scripts which pipe into my Fifo with them.

Low Priority:
    * A "go back to last place before last time seek was done" keybind, in case of accidentally hitting chapter skips or something.
    * Hotkey that can toggle screen size between 100% and whatever my preferred is.
    * View (and access) list of recently opened files.
    * For screenshot-template, have the file extension displayed with a - instead of a . Currently, one can only include .filetype or omit it altogether.

}}}
ncmpcpp {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Medium Priority
    * When holding spacebar to add music to playlist, don't add the last one at end of list multiple times.

Low Priority
    * Turn selected/highlighted item attribute to bold, not reverse.
    * Display album art on another window or when I prompt for it.
    * Half-page up/downs (or 5j/k's).

}}}
Ranger {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Medium Priority:
    * Have transfers show an ETA and other such details like what file is currently being copied and what has already been copied, not just a progress bar.
    * More color choices, like irssi can.
    * Allow .zshrc things to run through, such as aliases and functions, when you use :shell commands, not just for interactive shells.

Low Priority:
    * Always open ranger at its last closed location, instead of being forced to do '' at startup.
    * Choose what files are pasted first when copying a bunch of them.
    * Enhanced out-of-console previews: activate video previews (just some snapshot much like w3m for images, or better yet, several snapshots and it cycling through them), txt previews from an embeddable gvim or vim one (i.e. not just pager).
    * w3img shows a piece of its bottom occasionally, although it resets when I teleport to another folder.
        Did i affect this when editing the interface scripts, or was it always like this?

}}}
rssdler {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Low Priority:
    * Don't exit the rssdler process on errors, e.g., connection lost. (Forced to run a cron job to keep it up)

}}}
scrot {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Medium Priority
    * Scrot just one window, or just one display, or just set some pixel argument to specify how much to capture.

}}}
Transmission {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Priority
    * Preserve queue order on exit.
    * >3 file priorities.

Medium Priority:
    * Strange queue behavior: when moving to new queue positions, the bottom ones previously active (and now moved away to no longer be active) continue to be active regardless, while the moved queue are still queued/inactive. I have to pause/replay the moved active torrent to make it inactive and let transmission start the new queued torrent.

Low Priority:
    * Built-in RSS, meaning in particular that 3rd party RSS dlers can only download to watch directory, and not set each torrent hit to change its default download directory, or force them to queue on top (a feature uTorrent has).
        User-made script for this exists for queueing to top; as for different download directories, can run custom script to move particular RSS downloaded torrent files after the torrent completes.
    * >1 watch directory, and subsequently the default download directory depending on the watch directory or if torrent opened into Transmission directly.
    * Custom tags/labels for custom filtering.
    * No need to use Firefox plugin to start magnets into Transmission.
    * Don't require killing transmission-daemon before editing settings.json.

}}}
Transmission-remote-cli {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Priority:
    * Set default download location from transmission-remote-cli client.
    * Add a timeout so the selected item attribute resets.
        Afterwards, set that BOLD thing to REVERSE, so it's like ncmpcpp.

Low Priority:
    * Mouse support.
    * Somehow allow ranger to open containing folder of torrent.
    * Huge huge input lag when the file list is enormous (lagged on rahxephon with ~1000 files).
    * When i queue up/down when already at top/bottom, they add weird stats to my uploads (only happens when downloading).

}}}
urxvt/Xresources {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Medium Priority:
    * Have j/k scroll up/down the buffer during vicmd.

Low Priority:
    * Single quotes don't work in comments.

}}}
Vim {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

High Priority
    * rubber: Compile files with spaces in their name.

Medium Priority
    * EasyMotion: This is inspired from the browser search commands. Have the secondary options (e.g. when it spits out the same letter) start double digraphs and trigraphs. This allows you to know exactly the sequence to press, without having to hit one key, wait for your brain to process the next, and hit again.
    * EasyMotion: Allow f/F's to be case-insensitive, but smartcase when I do capitalize.
        (Maybe I can already do this by setting it to the EasyMotion n/N commands, whilst allowing a one key argument for the find. This also makes it easier in case I screw up so I can cycle with n/N.)
    * NERDTree: I want you as a Toggle, but I also want you to always autotree node to CWD.

Low Priority
    * Stop being so goddamn slow when scrolling through long lines and with syntax on. Setting max syntax through column shouldn't be an issue to begin with.
    * EasyMotion: Include the fold title as part of search.
    * NERDTree: 'cd' doesn't work in the tree, nor does :NERDTreeCWD.
    * Some plugin to track all the commands I do in normal mode and ex mode. This way, I can see how productive I can be by remapping the keys that take longest or shortest.

}}}
Zathura {{{
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Low Priority:
    * Have J/K be your PgUp/Downs, while <C-j><C-k> navigate to the beginning/end of the page. E.g., you're at the top of the page but don't see the whole page, <C-j> hits you to the end of the page, then <C-j> again hits you to the beginning of the next page, etc. etc.
