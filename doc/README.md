new philosophy
* more desktop app integration: use desktop apps over web apps if they have a
  particular advantage such as speed, desktop notifications, etc.
* more use of built-in shortcuts: stick with built-in shortcuts unless your
  customization drastically increases productivity, e.g., s/t to move prev/next
  tab in firefox
* ability to go from all gui to all hacker terminal
  * preferably a nice gui aesthetic like hdni with power commands
* stick with app launcher/focuser for most things, only keybind things you need
  instant access to, such as browser, todolist, and vim, but not e.g., spotlight
* keep lots of stuff minimized, e.g., calendar, wunderlist, spotify
* allow other users to easily access, understand, and use primary apps (general
  desktop movement, browser)
* some easy combination of both all gui and all themed/customized cli apps
* setup to be workable in three ways
  * power user with both hands on keyboard
  * power user with left hand on keyboard, right hand on touchpad
  * guest user performing common tasks such as web browsing and typing commands
* On browsers: modal editing just does not work here. Some pages work best under
their own controls, so it makes no sense to have an overarching normal mode
where you do browser navigation, and then you have to go to insert mode to work
on the page, e.g., mail, or even simple things such as text input from google
instant search.
This requires the emacs approach of purely modifiers, and use only keys that no
other app would.
