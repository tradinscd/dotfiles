# Description: A minimalistic approach which improves upon right-aligned-nick integration
#   through dynamic usage of the pipe (|) column.
# Note:
# * First taken from here, which mostly emulates the second link. Huge changes over time however.

# http://dotshare.it/dots/279/
# * Commented out lines with no changes are simply the default settings, and/or notes.
# * Symbol stylings to consider for the pipe column:
