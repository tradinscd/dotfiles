# This is a script for cronjob.

# I do this because occasionally xcape seems to break, and will stop working for a few seconds or sometimes not at all.
# It has variable success, and sometimes stops
# working altogether in some applications, like irssi. I have noticed that manually killing and remaking the process fixes
# this.
#set +e
#pkill xcape
#xcape -e 'Control_L=Escape' &
#set -e

#xcape
# apparently pkill xcape && xcape will only pkill xcape and not have the next line read, nor will xcape on a separate line
# work. apparently this one works and doesn't
# add a new process for xcape either, but I'm not sure if this solves the above noted problem.
#
# nope it didn't work
